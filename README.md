## Description
This project demonstrates to prospective employers collaborative skills and coding abilities, especially in the context of a scalable, user-focused MERN app. In this project, we created a MERN stack single-page application to encourage patronage at local businesses throughout Bexar County, San Antonio, TX. A person will be able to signup either as a viewer or a business. 

> **_NOTE 1:_** A person must be signed in as a user to view products. A person must be signed in as a business to add products.

## Project Requirements

```md
* Use React for the front end.

* Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server

* Must be able to retrieve, add, update, and delete data

* Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

* Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

* Have a polished UI.

* Be responsive.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Include authentication (JWT).

* Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).

* Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
